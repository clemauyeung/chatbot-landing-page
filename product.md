Explain this feature to a 10 year old. 

* This is a self-service feature. You’re not waiting for someone to tell you. Self-service, access your account yourself.
* Legacy world is your bank reaching out to you. This is a platform where customer initiate conversation with the bank. Traditionally, bank reached out to customers through SMS for any alerts, reminder, etc. This is a platform that lets customers initiate conversation and get info quickly.
