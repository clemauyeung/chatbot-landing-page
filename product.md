Explain this feature to a 10 year old. 

* This is a self-service feature. You’re not waiting for someone to tell you about your bank account. You can find out whenever you want.
* It used to be that the bank would reach out to you. This is a platform where customer initiate conversation with the bank. Traditionally, bank reached out to customers through text for any alerts, reminders, etc. This is a platform that lets customers initiate conversation and get their info quickly.
* Traditionally, it’s not a conversation (BAL example). It’s very rudimentary. Now customers have the ability to reply to the message. Customers can ask whatever is on their mind about their account.
* Customer has the power to transform a one-way conversation into a two-way conversation. Text is customer’s preferred channel and Capital One is in their channel. It’s familiar and it’s known.
* It's a personalized service. You’re talking to me as if you’re solving just my problem. It feels like Ben is doing it with me.
